# Fora Dilma

Fora Dilma is a React Native-powered app that provides the user a button to
press and accumulate _foras_. These are synced with a central server
periodically and added up with other users' foras, displayed on a counter within
the app.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the instructions
   [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to
   install React Native
3. Run `npm install -g react-native-cli` to obtain React Native CLI tools

## Usage

As of May 2016, React Native primarily design for OS X, and thus, the
instructions that follow refer exclusively to that platform.

1. Navigate to the repository folder
2. Run `react-native run-ios` to run on an iOS device or iOS simulator, or
   `react-native run-android` to run on an Android device or Android simulator

React Native should run on Windows and Linux as well, albeit at the expense of not
generating iOS binaries.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request

## History

The idea for this app came up during a humorous discussion with a friend of
mine (@PotatoProgrammer) on how we should develop an app that people in Brazil
would appreciate. Since the cause for Dilma's impeachment was a major news item
at the time, we felt it was a good idea to try to develop a simple game
referring to it. This repository is was came out of it.

Soon after coming up with the idea, we approached another friend (@breno12321)
and invited him to participate.

This was initially a private project but upon reaching the beta goals we decided
to cease active development as it was not very promising. I have since obtained
their permission to publish this as open-source, for whoever wants to improve
it or use it as a learning resource.
